# 🤖 Robotics Project: MetaDrive and ROS Integration 🛣️

This project integrates the vehicular simulation **MetaDrive** with the **ROS 2** (Robot Operating System 2) framework for managing and training a robotic controller.

## 📁 Main Directory Structure

The `~/robotics-project-all` directory contains the following main files and folders:

| File/Folder Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `1_comand_terminal.bash` | Script for **Terminal 1** (Launching ROS Bridges). |
| `2_comand_terminal.bash` | Script for **Terminal 2** (Starting MetaDrive and Socket Server). |
| `3_comand_terminal.bash` | Script for **Terminal 3** (Starting the ROS Controller Node). |
| `eval_model.bash` | Script to start **model evaluation**. |
| `train_model.bash` | Script to start **model training**. |
| `robotic_project` | Contains the code for the ROS controller node. |
| `metadrive` | Contains the MetaDrive environment and the related ROS bridges. |
| `ros2_vision_ws` | ROS 2 workspace for vision messages (optional/additional section). |
| `setup_vision_msgs_ws.bash` | Setup script for the `ros2_vision_ws` workspace. |
| `setup_ros_metadrive_bridge.bash` | Setup script for the ROS/MetaDrive bridge. |
| `start_project_config.bash` | Initial project configuration script. |
| `metadrive/bridges/ros_bridge/` | Main directory for ROS/MetaDrive integration. |

## 🚀 Startup Instructions: The Three Terminals

The project is designed to be started on **three separate and distinct terminals** by executing the commands in order:

### 1. Terminal 1: ROS Bridges (Socket Client)
Starts the ROS nodes responsible for communication (via sockets) with the MetaDrive environment.

* **File Executed:** `1_comand_terminal.bash`
* **Main Action:** Launches the ROS bridges from the launch file:
    * `/home/trueilorp/robotics-project-all/metadrive/bridges/ros_bridge/src/metadrive_example_bridge/launch/metadrive_example_bridge.launch.py`
* **Bridge Files:** The nodes include `camera_bridge.py`, `cmd_vel_bridge.py`, `lidar_bridge.py`, `obj_bridge.py`, and `state_and_lidar_bridge.py`.

### 2. Terminal 2: MetaDrive Environment (Socket Server)
Starts the MetaDrive simulation environment and the socket connection.

* **File Executed:** `2_comand_terminal.bash`
* **Main Action:** Generates the MetaDrive environment and opens the **socket server** connection with ROS.
* **Reference File:** `/home/trueilorp/robotics-project-all/metadrive/bridges/ros_bridge/ros_socket_server.py`

### 3. Terminal 3: ROS Controller Node
Starts the ROS control node which processes received data and sends commands to the vehicle.

* **File Executed:** `3_comand_terminal.bash`
* **Main Action:** Starts the ROS controller node.
* **Reference File:** `/home/trueilorp/robotics-project-all/robotic_project/src/metadrive_controller/metadrive_controller/main.py`

## 🧠 Model Training and Evaluation

The following scripts are used for training and evaluating the driving model:

* **Training:** Run `train_model.bash` in the root directory.
    * This starts the training script located at `/home/trueilorp/robotics-project-all/metadrive/bridges/ros_bridge/models_training`.
* **Evaluation:** Run `eval_model.bash` in the root directory.
    * This starts the evaluation script located at `/home/trueilorp/robotics-project-all/metadrive/bridges/ros_bridge/models_evaluation`.

### Models and Configuration

* **Pre-trained Models:** Two pre-trained models are available in the folder:
    * `/home/trueilorp/robotics-project-all/metadrive/bridges/ros_bridge/models`
* **Configuration:** Parameters for training and configuring the MetaDrive environment can be modified in the file:
    * `/home/trueilorp/robotics-project-all/metadrive/bridges/ros_bridge/config.json`
